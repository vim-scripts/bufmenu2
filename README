If you are used to opening zillions buffers like I am,
if furthermore, the files you edit have same first letter,
you might have faced a poor buffer menu with just
one submenu title displaying this first letter
and all your file names in this same submenu pane.
You're puzzled about that ?
I was. I searched for a script doing a nicer job. None :(
I wrote it myself. Not very quickly wrote, not very quick
at execution on my 350 Mhz ppc, BUT you should try
it to see if more balanced hierarchy fits your need.
Hey this is free ;)
Screenshots of the difference on a silly example
are available there : http://lauranger.free.fr/bufmenu_two.html
